# Purpose
This is a repo that has some tests written in Cypress.io framework. These tests were deliberately written to have some issues.
This is done `intentionally`, for training purposes. Goal is to learn how to `identify issues in test code`.

# Cheat sheet
//TODO: create & provide a link to the `common code smells` in the test code to make it `easier` to cross-check.
